# Jenkins Pipeline — From Job Creation to Jenkinsfile

Hands-on demo of creating a **Jenkins Pipeline** job connected to a Git repository (GitLab in this example), using a `Jenkinsfile` to define **build → test → deploy** stages.

> **Why pipeline jobs?** They are **pipeline-as-code**, support **parallelism**, **variables**, **conditions**, and live in **source control** — perfect for CI/CD. Freestyle jobs are OK for quick, simple runs but limited to UI fields.

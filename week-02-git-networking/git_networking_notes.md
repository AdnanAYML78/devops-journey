# 🧠 Week 2: Git, Environment Variables & Networking Basics

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Git fundamentals: init, add, commit, log, diff
- Branching, merging, and conflict resolution
- Setting and using environment variables in shell
- Basic networking: IP addresses, DNS, NAT, and firewalls
- Connecting via SSH to remote servers (e.g. DigitalOcean)

## 🛠️ Key Commands Practiced

```bash
# Git basics
git init
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git log
git branch
git merge

# Env variables
export MY_VAR="hello"
echo $MY_VAR

# Networking
ifconfig
ping google.com
dig openai.com
```

## 💡 Reflections

- Understanding Git visually helped me grasp how commits and branches work under the hood.
- Network tools like `ping`, `dig`, and `curl` are more useful than I realized — they're great for troubleshooting.
- Git merge conflicts were tricky but educational — I learned how to resolve them using VS Code and the CLI.

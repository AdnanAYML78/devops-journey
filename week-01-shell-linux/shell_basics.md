# 🐧 Week 1: Shell Scripting & Linux Basics

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How the shell works and why it's essential in DevOps
- Writing basic shell scripts to automate commands
- Using variables, conditionals, and loops in `.sh` scripts
- Managing file permissions with `chmod`, `chown`
- Navigating and manipulating files using the Linux CLI

## 🛠️ Commands Practiced

```bash
ls -l
chmod +x script.sh
cat /etc/os-release
echo "Hello World"
```

## 📌 Notes

Shell scripting saves time by automating repetitive server tasks. I now understand how to execute `.sh` files, define variables, and handle conditional logic.
